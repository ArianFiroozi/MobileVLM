We present MobileVLM, a competent multimodal vision language model (MMVLM) targeted to run on mobile devices. It is an amalgamation of a myriad of architectural designs and techniques that are mobile-oriented, which comprises a set of language models at the scale of 1.4B and 2.7B parameters, trained from scratch, a multimodal vision model that is pre-trained in the CLIP fashion, cross-modality interaction via an efficient projector. We evaluate MobileVLM on several typical VLM benchmarks. Our models demonstrate on par performance compared with a few much larger models. More importantly, we measure the inference speed on both a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 CPU and an NVIDIA Jeston Orin GPU, and we obtain state-of-the-art performance of 21.5 tokens and 65.3 tokens per second, respectively.

The MobileVLM architecture (right) utilizes MobileLLaMA as its language model, intakes $\mathbf{X}_v$ and $\mathbf{X}_q$ which are image and language instructions as respective inputs and gives $\mathbf{Y}_a$ as the output language response. LDP refers to a lightweight downsample projector (left).

## üóùÔ∏è Quick Start

#### Example for MobileLLaMA model inference

```python
import torch
from transformers import LlamaTokenizer, LlamaForCausalLM

model_path = 'mtgv/MobileLLaMA-1.4B-Chat'

tokenizer = LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
model = LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_path, torch_dtype=torch.float16, device_map='auto',
)

prompt = 'Q: What is the largest animal?\nA:'
input_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").input_ids

generation_output = model.generate(
    input_ids=input_ids, max_new_tokens=32
)
print(tokenizer.decode(generation_output[0]))
```
* For more advanced usage, please follow the [transformers LLaMA documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/llama).

# (or) What is the title of this book?
# (or) Is this book related to Education & Teaching?

args = type('Args', (), {
    "model_path": model_path,
